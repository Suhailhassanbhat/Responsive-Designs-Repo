# About this Project:

It is still in progress. Look out for updates here.

Analysis:
to find out earthquake vulnerability of Indian States based on four years of data.

Data:
Data for this project was collected from India's open govenment data platform (https://data.gov.in/ogpl_apis). Clean datasets can be found in this repo. Population data obtained from Census 2011 (https://www.census2011.co.in/states.php).

Methodology:
Most of the analysis was done using Microsoft Excel. Earthquakes recroded in India were distributed across the years from 2016 to 2018 to give a picture of the yearly pattern of these natural events. This data was related to population, to find out which highly populated states are at close range to the origins of these earthquakes. All these datasets are incluced in this repo.
