# What is my project?
Teachers in Indiana have been protesting in red demanding better pay https://bit.ly/37YadFu. In light of this event, the project does three things:

-- Compares salaries of teachers across states 

-- Shows the growth of salaries of educators over the past two decades

-- Compares salaries of teachers with other professions

# Where is my data coming from?

- Salaries of the different profession from the Bureau of Economic Analysis https://apps.bea.gov/itable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=70&step=1

# My current status 
I have collected and cleaned data. Visualized salaries across states
# Sketch of what the final project might look like

-A D3 map of the United States with Scrollytelling that shows states which have higher starting salaries compared to Indiana
- A drop down placeholder that can be used to look for salary growth of teachers over the past two decades for each state.
- A responsive bar chart with scrollytelling that compares salaries of teachers with other professions.
